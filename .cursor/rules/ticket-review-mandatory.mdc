# Ticket Review Mandatory

## Rule

After completing work on any ticket (TICKET-XXX), you MUST:

1. Run the review command: `cursor-agent-pm.reviewTicketCompletion`
2. OR use MCP tool: `ticket_review` with reviewType "complete"
3. Wait for review results before marking ticket as done

## When This Applies

- After completing all tasks in TaskList.md
- Before marking ticket status as "done"
- When agent believes work is complete

## How to Trigger Review

- Via Command Palette: "Review Ticket Completion"
- Via MCP: Call `ticket_review` tool
- Via Panel: Click "Review" button in ticket detail view

## Review Output

The review will analyze:
- Task completion status
- Acceptance criteria
- Implementation plan progress
- Discussion decisions

## Important

Do NOT skip this step. Always review before marking complete.
